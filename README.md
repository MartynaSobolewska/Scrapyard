# Scrapyard API 
Spring boot project that I started to learn core concepts of Spring Boot, cloud and design that I needed to know for working on backend. It comprises of multiple services using `Spring Cloud` to integrate them together. It contains a few local databases connected to the project using `Spring Data JPA`. It maintains layer division explained in `Layers in Spring Boot`. It uses `JWT Tokens` for security.`Project Lombok` for code conciseness. Global exception hander (`@ControllerAdvice`)  for clean exception handling.  `OpenAPI` for `Swagger` documentation generation. It was developed using `Test Driven Development`.

### Microservices process
Initially, All the endpoints were in one big "Scrapyard" application. It was transformed such that the API gateway is the user endpoint, handling the calls to a separate, auth service which transformes a bearer token into a hashed, signed JWT token to be used internally - by microservices hidden behind the gateway. All of this is abstracted from the user who just sends the bearer token obtained on login. The authentication is stateless due to all services sharing a secret signature to verify the JWT tokens generated by auth service.

## Data structures
The databases in Scrapyard have been separated to allow splitting Scrapyard into services.
